# C++ Constructors and Destructors

This repository contains explanations and logic for different types of constructors and destructors in C++.

---

## 1. Default Constructor (Inside Class)

**Aim:**  
To implement a default constructor inside the class.

**Theory:**  
- A default constructor is automatically called when an object is created.  
- It takes no arguments and assigns default values to data members.  

**Syntax:**  
```cpp
ClassName() {
   // initialization
}

Logic:

Define constructor inside the class.

Assign default values to members.

Create an object â†’ constructor is executed.



---

2. Default Constructor (Outside Class)

Aim:
To implement a default constructor outside the class.

Theory:

A constructor can be declared inside the class but defined outside using the scope resolution operator ::.


Syntax:

ClassName::ClassName() {
   // initialization
}

Logic:

Declare constructor in the class.

Define it outside with ClassName::.

Initialize members with default values.



---

3. Parameterized Constructor

Aim:
To implement a parameterized constructor.

Theory:

A parameterized constructor takes arguments.

It allows initializing data members with custom values at object creation.


Syntax:

ClassName(type arg1, type arg2) {
   // initialization
}

Logic:

Pass values while creating object.

Constructor assigns these values to data members.

Different objects can be initialized with different values.



---

4. Copy Constructor

Aim:
To implement a copy constructor.

Theory:

A copy constructor initializes a new object as a copy of an existing object.

Takes a reference to another object of the same class.


Syntax:

ClassName(const ClassName &obj) {
   // copy values
}

Logic:

Copy constructor receives another object as input.

Copies the values of its members into the new object.

Used when creating duplicate objects.



---

5. Copy Constructor (Q2 â€“ Multiple Attributes)

Aim:
To implement a copy constructor for objects having multiple attributes (e.g., name, price, author).

Logic:

Define a parameterized constructor to initialize multiple values.

Create a copy constructor that takes a reference object.

Copy each attribute (like name, price, author) into the new object.

Demonstrates deep/shallow copy behavior.



---

6. Destructor

Aim:
To implement a destructor in C++.

Theory:

Destructor is a special function called automatically when an object goes out of scope.

It has the same name as the class with a ~ prefix.

Used for cleanup tasks like freeing memory or closing files.


Syntax:

~ClassName() {
   // cleanup
}

Logic:

Define destructor inside the class.

Destructor is automatically called when object is destroyed.

Useful for memory management and resource cleanup.

ðŸ“Œ Summary

Default Constructor â†’ Initializes objects with default values.

Parameterized Constructor â†’ Initializes objects with specific values.

Copy Constructor â†’ Creates a new object as a copy of another.

Destructor â†’ Performs cleanup when an object is destroyed.
